Practical – Playlist application</h1>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Your task is to build a simple web application that will allow the
creation of music playlists. Songs will be chosen from a list of 193
Beatles songs given in a static data file. As the user chooses songs to
be added to the playlist metadata regarding the songs will be displayed
on the screen.</p>
<p>Technologies you will need to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HTML5 for the structure of web pages</p></li>
<li><p>CSS3 for presentation of web pages</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript for client-side programming</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section"></h2>
<h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
<p>We will use a dataset that contains metadata about Beatles songs.
This dataset is available under a “CC0: Public Domain” license from
Kaggle:</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chadwambles/allbeatlesspotifysongdata2009remaster">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chadwambles/allbeatlesspotifysongdata2009remaster</a></p>
<p>There are 6 CSV files in this dataset, we will use only one of these:
TheBeatlesCleaned.csv</p>
<p>You do not need to download this file from Kaggle. It is stored under
the data directory on StudRes:</p>
<p>CS2003/Practicals/Practical2-Web1-Playlist/data/TheBeatlesCleaned.csv</p>
<p>Note that the file we provide on StudRes is slightly modified to make
parsing easier. Specifically, the lines are separated by \n characters,
the columns on a line are separated by a ; (semi-colon) character and
the fields are not quoted. See data/readme.txt for more details if you
are interested.</p>
<p>This file contains 11 columns and 193 rows (excluding the header
line). The column names and their use in this practical are listed in
the following.</p>
<p>The first column is “id. The value stored in this column will not be
visible on screen, however you may use it as part of your program to
identify entries in the dataset.</p>
<p>Columns 2—4 and 11 (“year”, “album”, “song”, “duration_ms”) will be
displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>Columns 5—10 (“danceability”, “energy”, “speechiness”,
“acousticness”, “liveness”, “valence”) are so called audio features. The
Kaggle page for this dataset defines audio features as “how Spotify
measures emotion in their music catalog”. You are <strong>not</strong>
required to use these values at all in your implementation, though feel
free to use them in creative ways if you want!</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Write a node.js program called <strong>convert.js</strong> which
will convert the CSV file into a JSON file. Choose an appropriate data
structure for the JSON file. This program should read data from
data/TheBeatlesCleaned.csv and write the output to
data/TheBeatlesCleaned.json when run from inside the Web1-playlist
directory. Do not use an external CSV parsing library. You may assume
that the line separator is “\n” and the column separator is “,” (comma)
and that the values do not contain any comma characters in
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a web application using HTML, CSS and client side
JavaScript with the following features.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a list of all songs from the data file.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a placeholder for a playlist. A playlist is a set of
selected songs, together with some aggregate information about the
contents of the playlist.</p></li>
<li><p>For each song, design and implement a way of adding it to a
playlist.</p></li>
<li><p>Songs should be listed in the order of addition in the
playlist.</p></li>
<li><p>For every song that was previously added to the playlist, design
and implement a way of removing it from the playlist.</p></li>
<li><p>The playlist should render the list of songs in the playlist. In
addition it should show the number of songs in the playlist and the
total duration of the playlist.</p></li>
<li><p>Songs (in the list of all songs and in the playlist) are
displayed in the following format:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>NAME</strong> (Album: <strong>ALBUM</strong>, Year:
<strong>YEAR</strong>, Duration: <strong>DURATION</strong>)</p></li>
<li><p>Where NAME comes from the “song” field,<br />
ALBUM comes from the “album” field,<br />
YEAR comes from the “year” field, and<br />
DURATION comes from the “duration_ms” field.</p></li>
<li><p>Duration is given in milliseconds. Convert it to a MM:SS format
(minutes and seconds, separated by a colon). So a value of “120853”
(from the song Please Please Me should be displayed as “2:01”). Second
values are to be rounded to the nearest integer and zero-padded to two
digits.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Make sure your program does not depend on the particular dataset
you are given. We should be able to add/remove/edit new songs to the CSV
file, run <strong>convert.js</strong> to convert this file to JSON and
use your web application with this new JSON file without any further
changes. You may assume that the columns in the CSV file and the file
format will not change.</p></li>
<li><p>Use</p></li>
<li><p>Test your program fully and document your testing in the
report.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend an incremental approach: make sure that each part of
your program works before moving on to the next part. Make a safe copy
of whatever you have got working so far so that you always have a
working solution to submit while you are developing the next part of
your solution. This should allow you to experiment with different ways
of organising your code and implementing functionality without worrying
of breaking things.</p>
<h2 id="hints">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Look into the following methods from the File system (fs) library
of node.js: readFileSync, toLocaleString, writeFileSync</p></li>
<li><p>Use an HTML validator and a CSS validator to validate your
code.</p></li>
<li><p>Use strict mode for JavaScript and check for errors/warnings in
the JavaScript console of your web browser.</p></li>
<li><p>It is good practice to write your HTML code, CSS code, and
JavaScript code in separate files and link to the CSS and JavaScript
files from within the HTML file as appropriate.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>Your MMS submission should be a single .zip or .tar.gz file
containing the following.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Code.</strong> Any HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. These
should be in a single directory (which may have subdirectories as
needed) with all the source code needed to run your application. Your
submission should not require a server-side program. It should be
possible to take your submitted directory, copy it to a user’s
nginx_default directory on the School host servers and use your
application through a web browser by navigating to the right
directory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Report.</strong> A single PDF file which is a report
which uses the report template given on StudRes. In your report, where
appropriate, try to concentrate on why you did something in a particular
way (i.e. design decisions) rather than just explaining what the code
does.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You must not use any external / third-party libraries or source
code.</p>
<p>Please do not use absolute paths for files or URLs in your
submission. You should not need to access any external resources from
your code. So, all your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files (as well as any
other files, such as images, data files, or files created by your code)
must all be in the single directory that you submit.</p>
<p>If the marker cannot run the code you have submitted by copying it to
the host servers and viewing it through a web browser, then you will be
penalised in marking.</p>
<h2 id="marking">Marking</h2>
<p>The submission will be marked on the University’s common reporting
scale according to the General Mark Descriptors in the Student Handbook
at:</p>

<p>To achieve excellent marks, you should meet all the requirements with
exceptional clarity and demonstrated insight.</p>
<h2 id="lateness">Lateness</h2>
<h2 id="section-1"></h2>
<p>The standard penalty for late submission applies (1 mark per 8 hour
period, or part thereof):</p>

<h2 id="section-2"></h2>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<p>We encourage you to discuss your assignment with other members of the
class. This may be especially useful for discussing the requirements.
However, the code you develop for your solution should be your won,
individual work, and your report should be written by you alone. Please
ensure you are following the relevant guidelines on Good Academic
Practice as outlined at:</p>
